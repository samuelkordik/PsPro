# PsPro
For a many years now, my personal daily devotions begin with reading five psalms and one chapter of Proverbs, selected based on the day of the month. Reading these daily results in completing the entire book of Psalms and book of Proverbs each month. The Psalms root my mindset and outlook for the day in an attitude of worship and humility while the Proverbs allow me to encounter great wisdom and recalibrate my decision-making each day.

This is a simple PHP web page that uses the ESV online API to get the text for the psalms and proverbs each day. You will need an API key, which can be obtained here: [https://api.esv.org/account/create-application/](https://api.esv.org/account/create-application/).

Place that API key into the marked spot in `example_config.php` and then rename the file to `config.php`. 

This page implements the Bootstrap template for styling.
